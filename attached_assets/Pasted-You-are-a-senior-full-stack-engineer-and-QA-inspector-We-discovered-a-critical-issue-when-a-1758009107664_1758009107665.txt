You are a **senior full-stack engineer and QA inspector**.  
We discovered a critical issue: when a **Consumer clicks "Add to Cart"**, it leads to a **404 error**.  

Your tasks:

---

## 1. Fix Cart Page
- Create a **Cart Page** under `/cart`.
- Show all items added to cart with product details (title, price, quantity, image).
- Implement **update quantity**, **remove item**, and **clear cart** functions.
- Display **cart summary** (total items, total price).
- Provide a **checkout button** → leads to placeholder Checkout page.

---

## 2. Add Missing Pages
- **Checkout Page** — display shipping form + payment placeholder.
- **Order Confirmation Page** — show success message + order details.
- Ensure all routing uses Next.js App Router, no 404s.

---

## 3. End-to-End Inspection
Perform a **complete audit** of the entire app:
- **Header/NavBar** → all links working, cart icon shows item count.
- **Home Page** → featured items visible, buttons clickable.
- **Browse/Listings Page** → filters, search, and cards functional.
- **Listing Detail Page** → add to cart, contact producer working.
- **Producer Dashboard** → CRUD listings work, navigation works.
- **Auth** → register/login/logout working with sessions.
- **Cart** → add, edit, remove, checkout functional.
- **Checkout → Confirmation** → no broken routes, correct state flow.

---

## 4. QA & Production Readiness
- Fix **all broken buttons, links, and components**.
- Ensure **responsive design** (mobile/desktop).
- Add **toasts/snackbars** for cart actions (added, removed, updated).
- Ensure **state persists** properly (cart should not clear on refresh unless intended).
- Run a **test of each user flow**:  
  - Producer flow (listings CRUD)  
  - Consumer flow (browse → add to cart → checkout → confirmation)  
  - Auth flow (login/logout/register)  

---

## 5. Deliverables
When done, provide:
1. Fixed **Cart Page** code with proper UI.
2. Added **Checkout + Confirmation Pages**.
3. Updated **Navbar/Header** with working Cart link.
4. Short **file tree** of changed files.
5. **Run instructions** for local dev and production build.
6. **Demo credentials** for QA.
7. **End-to-end test results** (manual or automated).
8. Note **any remaining limitations**.

---

## 6. Design & UX
- Use **Tailwind + Framer Motion** for smooth animations.
- Cart icon with badge count (animates on add/remove).
- Professional, consistent styling across all pages.
- Accessible (aria labels, focus states).
- Provide micro-interactions (hover, button presses, transitions).

---

## 7. Next Steps
After fixes, **review all components and flows** again and self-critique:  
“Would this pass as production-ready for a live consumer marketplace?”  
If no → fix until yes.

---

**Begin now.** Start by fixing the Cart Page, then add Checkout + Confirmation, and finally perform full end-to-end inspection and QA fixes.
