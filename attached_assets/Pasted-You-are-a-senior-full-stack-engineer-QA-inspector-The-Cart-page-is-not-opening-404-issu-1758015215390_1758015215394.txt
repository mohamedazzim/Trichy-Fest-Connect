You are a **senior full-stack engineer + QA inspector**.  
The **Cart page is not opening (404 issue)**. You must **fix it**, then **audit and verify all navigation/redirect pages**, ensuring every route renders properly.

---

## 1. Fix Cart Page
- Implement the `/cart` page so it renders correctly.
- Show cart items with product details (image, title, qty, price).
- Add cart summary (total items, total price).
- Include actions: update quantity, remove item, clear cart, checkout button.

---

## 2. Redirects & Navigation Audit
- Collect a list of **all possible navigation routes** triggered by:
  - Header / Navbar links
  - Footer links
  - Buttons (e.g., Add to Cart, Checkout, Dashboard)
  - Internal redirects (e.g., after login, after posting a product)
- For each route:
  1. Verify if the page exists and renders.
  2. If missing, **create the page** with minimal placeholder content + proper layout.
  3. If broken, **fix the navigation/linking**.

---

## 3. End-to-End Verification
Perform a full inspection:
- **Auth Flow**: Register, login, logout → redirect to correct pages.
- **Producer Flow**: Dashboard → add/edit/delete product → redirect back correctly.
- **Consumer Flow**: Browse → product detail → add to cart → cart page → checkout → confirmation.
- **Admin Flow (if available)**: Moderate listings → redirect works.

---

## 4. QA & Production-Ready Fixes
- Ensure **no navigation leads to 404 or blank page**.
- Add toasts/snackbars for success/failure of redirects (optional).
- Ensure responsive layouts remain intact after fixes.
- Add **loading/fallback states** for page transitions.

## 5. Deliverables
Return:
1. Fixed **Cart Page** code.
2. A **complete list of all routes/pages** (with their paths).
3. Status for each route: `works ✅ / fixed 🛠️ / newly created ✨`.
4. Updated file tree for changed/added files.
5. **Run instructions** for dev & production build.
6. Demo credentials for testing.
7. Test results (manual or automated).

---

## 6. Final QA
After fixes:
- Self-critique: *“Does every navigation and redirect reliably render a page without errors?”*
- If not, fix until the answer is **yes**.

---

**Begin now.** Start by fixing the Cart page, then enumerate and verify every possible navigation redirect, fixing or creating pages where needed, until the entire app is fully connected and production-ready.
